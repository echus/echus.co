      <h1>Hi, I'm Varvara ðŸ‘‹</h1>
      <p>
      I'm a software designer with a background in physics and
      a passion for data. I love designing and building web-based software
      solutions that help make research data accessible and easy to use.
      </p>
      <p>
      I prioritise designing user-focused, modular, maintainable and
      well-documented software systems, as well as establishing good
      engineering practices to ensure long term sustainability.
      </p>
      <p>
      Feel free to get in touch with me about interesting projects I might be
      able to help with at <em>varvara (at) echus.co</em>.
