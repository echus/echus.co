      <h3>
      I design web-based software solutions for research data 👩🏼‍💻
      </h3>
      <p>
      I'm a software designer with a background in physics and a love for data.
      I design and build web-based software solutions that help make research
      data accessible and easy to use.
      </p>
      <p>
      I prioritise designing user-focused, modular, maintainable and
      well-documented software systems, as well as establishing good
      engineering practices to ensure long term sustainability.
      </p>
      <p>
      Get in touch with me at <em>varvara (at) echus.co</em> to discuss how I
      could help with your project - I'd love to hear from you!
